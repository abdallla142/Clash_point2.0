## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Installation

No complex installation or build steps are required.

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```sh
    git clone https://your_repository_url.git
    ```
2.  **Run the website:**
      * **Simple Method**: Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
      * **Developer Method**: For a better development experience with live reloading, use a tool like the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

## Code Structure

This project is contained within a single `index.html` file for simplicity.

  * **`<style>` block**: All CSS, including custom properties and animations, is located in a `<style>` tag in the document's `<head>`.
  * **`<body>` section**: Contains all the HTML for the page structure.
  * **`<script>` block**: The JavaScript logic is placed in a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>`. It is organized into modules for initialization, animations, sound, and interactivity. Content like champion data and FAQ questions is stored in a `CONTENT` object for easy management.
